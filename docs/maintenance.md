# SentinelFlow Maintenance Log

## Active Milestones

### Milestone 43A & 43B — Native Approval & Action Center Queues: Complete
- Replaced mock integrations with native SOQL and DML for Sentinel_Incident__c.
- Implemented Guardian Gate (Approvals) and Execution Gate (Action Center).
- Linked Case creation and Sentinel_Audit_Log__c / Zentom_Policy_Decision__c to executions.
- Safely deployed and tested.

### Milestone 43C — Dashboard Filter UX Improvements: Complete
- Unified Time Range, Risk, Status, Environment, Type, and AI Confidence filters into a responsive `.filters-container`.
- Introduced macro "Preset Views" to automatically apply filter combinations.
- Updated Apex wrapper class (`IncidentRow`) and backend queries to fetch and expose `Environment__c`, `AI_Confidence__c`, and `AI_Reasoning_Status__c`.
- Kept architecture lightweight by applying filters strictly on the client side against the fetched payload.

### Milestone 43D — Near-Realtime Telemetry Widgets: Planning
- Drafted initial plan in `docs/near-realtime-telemetry-widgets.md`.
- Focus on operational trend widgets via near-realtime polling and client-side derivations.
