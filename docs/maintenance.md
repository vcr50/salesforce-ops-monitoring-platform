### Milestone 43C — Dashboard Filter UX Improvements: Complete
- Unified Time Range, Risk, Status, Environment, Type, and AI Confidence filters into a responsive `.filters-container`.

### Milestone 43F — Approval Escalation Paths: Complete
- Added `ESCALATION_THRESHOLD_HOURS` to `ZentomDashboardController.cls`.
